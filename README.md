# MRN Training on Mathlib

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and enhancement of the MRN (Model Recovery Neural Network) training utilized within the Mathlib framework. It aims to leverage symbolic reasoning capabilities to improve mathematical computations and model recovery processes.

## Key Features
* Symbolic reasoning integration for better performance.
* Comprehensive training module for MRN.
* Tools for evaluating the performance of the trained models.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hzc1234520/mathlib-mrn-training.git
cd mathlib-mrn-training

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the MRN model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```

Ensure to modify the configuration file according to your requirements.
